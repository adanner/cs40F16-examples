# OpenGL Tests

Files in this folder come from the source code for the OpenGL 4.0 Shading Language Cookbook. Code is available on [github](https://github.com/daw42/glslcookbook). Though a license is missing, [issue 37](https://github.com/daw42/glslcookbook/issues/37) indicates it may likely have a CC or MIT license. 


This folder has been modified slightly from the github source to build a small cookbook library in the current folder. 

This code requires the following packages

 * OpenGL 4.4
 * GLM >= 0.9.6
 * GLFW >= 3.0 


# Chapter 1 Examples

These examples come from Chapter 1 of the text, as noted in the original readme

> After a successful build, the examples can be executed via command-line arguments.  To see what examples are available, just run the executable
without any arguments.
